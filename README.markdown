Library for drawing railroad diagrams in Swift.

Features:

- Text inside a box can be multi-line text.

Future enhancements:

- Decoration could do with more configuration options.

Limitations:

- There is no wrap-around for very long diagrams to make them fit on a page.
- iOS only for now, no OS X support yet.
- The code is a mess!
- Drawing isn't always precise, need to fine-tune this!!!
